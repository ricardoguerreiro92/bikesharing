# Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview
- On a trip to New York City me and my friend Kate realized how easy was to move around the city while sightseeing with an unlikely "friend" citibike.<br> By doing so we figured we could bring a proposal to our hometown Des Moine, Iowa to recreate the same type of business. We gathered some data from Citibike website, cleaned it up with python's panda's library and used Tableau for our visualizations.

## Results

### - Checkout times

- What is the average trip duration?<br>From the data we gathered from August 2019 most of Citibike customers use the service between 4 to 16 minutes at a time.
### - Checkout times by Gender

- What is the average trip duration based on gender?<br>Our results show that men use the service the most but when we look at the trip duration all genders look like they use Citibike for the same amounts of time in average.
### - August Peak Times

- What are the peak times for Citibike? In the graph above we can see Citibike is most used between 8AM & 9AM as well as between 4PM & 7PM.
### - Trips by Weekday

- How are the peak times distributed? To help us visualize this we came up with a heatmap that confirms our August Peak Times graph where bikes are used mostly between 6 to 9AM and 5-7PM during weekdays while on the weekends is fairly distributed throughout the day which tells us that during the week this service is typically used by people who is going to work while on the weekends there is a more spreadout usage due to tourism and people's enjoying their days off.
### - Trips by Weekday by Gender

- To further analyize the previous heatmap we added genders and verified male users are the ones who use Citibike more often. And in the graph below we go deeper and verify most users are subscribers meaning most of their revenue comes from daily commuters.
### - Trips by Weekday by Customer Type & Gender

### - Top Starting Locations
- The following visualizations show us Citibikes are used mostly in Midtown and Lower Manhattan. With trips averaging between 4-16 minutes the top starting and ending locations are very close/similar to each other.

## Summary
- In summary we verified the Peak Usage Times for August were between 6 & 9AM and 5 & 7PM. Riders use Citibike mainly for commuting purposes, therefore the short Ride Times & Peak Times, and men is who use it the most. With this analysis we also verified most of the revenue comes from subscribers which reinforces that Citibike is typically used for work commute.
- I believe bringing a service such as Citibike to Des Moine could be a good idea considering the fact that the city would become much greener with daily commutes being done on a bicycle, would greatly improve traffic all round and help bring more life into the city with easier and faster access to monuments, museums and other places of interest.
